This is a drupal module meant to aid in the use of citeproc-js.
Currently this module does not support all the disambiguation features of citeproc-js, for now to get them you should write your own javascript to overide ir_citation_run.js.

There are currently some issues with duplication of metadata on the javascript side.
An issue with older CSLs: http://citationstyles.org/downloads/upgrade-notes.html#default-locale



There is an issue with a metadata specification mismatch in regards to naming:

MODS does not require name-parts to have a type:
http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-userguide-elements.html#namepart

Citeproc-js does:
http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#name

So any MODS should have these present.
There is currently a fallback to type='family' (family is required to be present by citeproc-js) hardcoded for any non-typed namepart.
This is not appropriate and creates overwriting issues.  It is implemented to convienently prevent crashes.
