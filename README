This is a drupal module meant to aid in the use of citeproc-js.
Currently this module does not support all the disambiguation features of citeproc-js, for now to get them you should write your own javascript to overide ir_citation_run.js.

This module is currently experimental. Under heavy development.
It relies hevily on the demo code from citeproc-js for testing.
