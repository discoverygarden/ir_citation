Summary of changes to citeproc-js since version 1.0.0 release.

==========================
Changes in version 1.0.195
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Wake up strip-periods on month date parts.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.194
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Render hyphen as en-dash in locator strings.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.193
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix bug in disambiguate="true" disambiguation, when used
  together with disambiguate-add-names. Thanks to user
  Zotero user bevweber for reporting the fault.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.192
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Suppress only author, and only if it is the first-occurring
  name, when suppress-author toggle is set. (The fix is slightly
  more aggressive -- suppression will also occur if author is the
  first of multiple variables set on the variable attribute of 
  cs:names. This affects only a single style at present (din-1505-2.csl,
  in which "author" and "composer" are used as a pair).


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.191
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix bug in near-note position detection. Was true
  when when distance was zero upon the first reference
  to the source. Now returns false in this case.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.190
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix bug in strip-periods when set on cs:text macro calls or
  cs:group elements. Thanks to Liam McHugh-Russell for identifying
  the error.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.189
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Treat short-form titles as a separate variable
  when sniffing for parallel cites.

- Remove "names" (encompassing any variable rendered
  via cs:names) from the list of mid-cite variables.

- Remove legacy code that attempts to work with
  "names" when sniffing parallel cites.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.188
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix breakage in second-field-align when macro containing date is 
  used as sort key in cs:bibliography. Reported by Sebastian Karcher
  (adamsmith).


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.187
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Provide a discriminator sequence hint on keys set during
  author-grouped sorts, to prevent decay of the sequence during
  final sort.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.186
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Suppress only duplicate punctuation at end of citation
  (do not suppress duplicate parens).


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.185
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix missing default delimiter and range delimiter
  affecting styles that use collapse="year-suffix".


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.184
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Suppress inter-cite delimiter if subsequent prefix begins
  with a comma.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.183
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Do not suppress a semicolon delimiter when reconciling punctuation.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.182
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- ownerDocument is a property, not a method.
  Fixed in xmldom.js.

- Suppress text-case="title" transform when
  (off-CSL) language variable begins with a valid
  language tag that is non-en, or when default-locale
  is non-en and language variable is either not set,
  or set to a non-en value.

- Provide an option to remove behavior that is
  not standard CSL from the processor for production
  use.

- Use en-dash for collapsed citation ranges.

- Provide code for future configurability of both
  page range and citation collapse range delimiter 
  as a locale term.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.181
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Do not insert space as a placeholder when applying
  strip-periods. In the only known use case in which this
  is significant (preserving space in abbreviated journal
  titles), it results in an incorrectly formatted string.
  The new behavior is simpler, both to code and to explain,
  reflects the plain meaning of the attribute name, and
  conforms to the CSL specification.

- Correctly process top-level cs:names nodes (those without
  a cs:substitute parent). This covers a recent CSL proposal,
  which will allow the volume of name formatting code in many 
  CSL styles to be significantly reduced.

- Place suffix on cs:name-part nodes of name="family" outside
  of a name suffix, when the name is rendered in "vanilla"
  ordering (i.e. not in sort ordering). This brings the
  processor into line with a recent proposal to allow affixes
  on cs:name-part.

- Fix a delimiter bug affecting styles that disambiguate by 
  applying a year suffix, with collapsing, where year-suffix-delimiter
  is not specified. No such styles exist as far as we know, but
  it was a bug, and it's now fixed.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.180
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Eliminate potential extraneous trailing space when applying
  strip-periods.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.179
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Honor givenname options set within macros when used as sort keys.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.178
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Adopt a method for recognizing "sub verbo" term that does
  not touch the input string shared with the calling application.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.177
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Don't escape HTML superscript markup in output.

- Fix bug in quoted escaping of numeric field content.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.176
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Record the processor styleID in citeproc.opt.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.175
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Convert Unicode superscript characters to marked-up
  equivalents in RTF and HTML output. This permits the
  use of these characters in locale term strings where
  superscript is required, while producing output that
  will be reliably rendered by target applications.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.174
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Correctly suppress "normal" font forms as the
  top-level font declaration of their class, as this
  can have unexpected side effects depending on the 
  style.

- Prevent leakage of formatting parameters between
  the cs:name-part elements of different cs:names
  nodes within the same cite.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.173
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Extend dropping-particle handling implemented in
  changeset 9dd55c95979b to names rendered in sort
  order.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.172
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Properly render encoded rich text markup embedded in
  ordinal suffix terms.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.171
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Ignore name terms that are missing from the locale files
  when generating labels in cs:names.

- Log message with CSL.debug() rather than CSL.error()
  when falling back from unknown locale.

- Log message with CSL.debug() rather than CSL.error() when 
  fixing up non-fatal but weird date values.

- Step past comment nodes silently (this is a simple noop
  for the processor, so save the chatter in the log files).


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.170
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Do not attempt to replace en-dash with hyphen on 
  undefined value in CSL.Node.text.

- Ignore decorations array on cs:institution nodes.

***

Both issues reported by Faolan.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.169
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Do not attempt to apply affixes to name parts
  that evaluate false. Fault reported by
  Faolan Cheslack-Postava.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.168
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Provide missing insertPublisherAndPlace() function
  in xmldom.js. WebKit systems will now run again.

- Attempt to execute publisherOutput only if it has 
  been instantiated for use.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.167
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Replace several largely incomprehensible functions used
  to generate alphabetic suffixes with a short function
  from Avram Lyon that is concise, readable, and does the 
  same thing.

- Implement paired rendering and "and"-wise joins of multiple 
  publishers and publisher-places, where (a) rendered as the sole 
  text elements within a group, (b) with no affixes on the two 
  text elements, and (c) the data consist of semicolon-delimited 
  lists of equal length, and (d) (at least) name-delimiter 
  is supplied on the ancestor cs:citation or cs:bibliography 
  node.  The "and" term used for the join, if any, is also that
  specified on the ancestor node.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.166
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Remove hasOwnProperty() condition wrapper
  from key iteration loop used for the
  match="none" condition evaluation. The target
  variable might be an array, in which case
  WebKit systems and Tracemonkey produce
  differing results (WebKit filters the 
  indices with this function, Firefox doesn't).

- Recognize en-dash equally with hyphen when
  evaluating page numbers for context pluralization.

- Some minor code cleanup.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.165
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Protect against undefined skey and ikey elements
  when removing names from citeproc.registry.namereg.

- Always use the shortest permitted form of names
  when building item ambig keys.

- Reset advance_mode toggle when initializing
  disambiguation engine.

- Avoid unnecessary reruns of the disambiguation
  queue in disNames().

- Fix bad conversion of string to object in registry
  dodeletes() method. This code is probably never used
  anyway, but if it does, it will work correctly now.

- Remove unused debugging function from api_cite.js


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.164
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix a subtle bug in the interaction of the names-based
  and cite-based disambiguation engines, affecting styles
  that rely on names-based disambiguation with givenname
  expansion.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.163
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Recognize dates when entered in cheater syntax
  (via the note variable). Syntax is:
  {:original-date: 2001-01-10} 


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.162
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Tell the truth when reporting label offsets to
  the calling application.

- Remove some unused code relating to names.

- Further small adjustments to the handling of
  name particles.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.161
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix various small bugs in the parsing of name
  particles and the application of formatting
  and affixes to names.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.160
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Make sorting work against the citation-label
  virtual variable.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.159
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Run processor in a try/catch to prevent
  a crash during preview from blocking
  reconstruction of the registry.

- Eliminate nesting closure that was causing
  a non-fatal tag mismatch.

- Force all-uppercase terms to lowercase
  (a hack that really should not be necessary,
  and may not be required with recent fixes).


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.158
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Reimplement citation-label to permit configuration
  of the generated string. The algorithm can be controlled
  by adjusting the "trigraph" string in citeproc.opt.trigraph.

  The string consists of a series of specifiers delimited by ":",
  which define the format for strings generated against a
  nameset corresponding in length to the position of the
  specifier (beginning with 1). Each specifier must begin
  with "A", and must consist only of characters "A", "a", and "0".
  where "A" indicates a name boundary, and "0" indicates a
  digit in the "issued" year.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.157
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- A more comprehensive fix for "sub verbo" -> "sub-verbo",
  that will work with match="all" with both forms of the
  term.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.156
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix bugs in evaluation of match="all".

- Properly split and evaluate label names in
  locator attribute on cs:if and cs:else-if.

- Special handling of "sub verbo", to treat it as
  a single token on the locator attribute.

- Correctly encode guillemet character in find-and-replace 
  operation.

==========================
Changes in version 1.0.155
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- When initialize-with is not set on a name, and
  the short form is used, and disambiguate-add-givenname="true",
  jump immediately to the full name form, without trying
  to disambiguate by adding initials. This conforms to the
  CSL 1.0 specification.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.154
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Do not flag style as position sensitive (thereby
  disabling grouped sorting mechanism) merely
  due to the fact that et-al-subsequent-min or
  et-al-subsequent-use-first are set; set this
  flag ONLY when these values differ from their
  plain counterparts.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.153
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Massive overhaul of names formatting code,
  to make it maintainable. Several things that
  were broken and basically unfixable in the
  old code now work properly.

- Do not force lowercase on Celtic clan names.

- Do not add a stray period to titles in
  Chicago note styles, when quotes run up against
  the cite join delimiter because of a missing
  page number in a subsequent cite.

- In in-text author-date styles that perform
  collapsing (and in these styles only), group
  citations by the author part of the string,
  so that collapsing never fails due to the
  vagaries of (say) date sorting. Addresses an
  issue raised by Bruce D'Arcus.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.152
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Correctly compose the forcing of itemIDs to string.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.151
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Force all itemIDs to string on initial insert.
  May avoid undefined citationID and pkey
  errors.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.150
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Some cleanup of core disambiguation code in disambig_cites.js. 
  Greater clarity, possibly a slight time saving.

- Normalize quote chars to avoid "sep is undefined" error on 
  mismatched quote marks.

- Fix bug in year-suffix assignment code.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.149
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix bug in flipflop nesting with RTF output.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.148
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix bug in the application of an explicit 
  year-suffix collapse delimiter to an implicit 
  year-suffix.

- Eliminate a couple of redundant code blocks that 
  would have triggered unnecessary disambiguation operations.

- Provide a skeleton function for embedding bibliographic data
  adjacent to rendered bibliography entries.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.147
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Debugging trace to help track down the cause of
  "sep is undefined" error, should it persist.

- Hard-code a comma between cites with the same author
  (hack to restore previous processor behavior, pending
  changes to CSL to permit this delimiter to be controlled
  explicitly)


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.146
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix bug in isInstitution toggle introduced in last
  set of changes.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.145
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Require new isInstitution toggle with lone family name
  element to force it to render as an institution.

- Do not truncate multiple variables on a name node
  to a single variable in an in-text style unless in 
  citation area.

- Move an inter-name-variable delimiter from after a preceding 
  name label (wrong) to before the label (correct).

- Convert all apostrophes in content strings, not only the
  first one encountered in the string.

- Do not merge identical editor and translator if the
  combined term label is empty.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.144
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Honor a fullname request in the bibliography,
  regardless of what has happened with name
  disambiguation settings in citations.

- Fix bugs producing "sep is not defined" and 
  "state.fun.decorate [params[0]][params[1]] is not a function"
  errors.

- Fix institution delimiter bug.

- Adjust punctuation to satisfy French orthographic
  rules.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.143
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Do not apply text_escape when building strings
  for purposes other than display. Fixes sort issues
  on Scandinavian and other non-ascii character sets.

- Fix potentially serious bug in registry handing of 
  uncited items, that could result in incomplete 
  registration of internal item data.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.142
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Provide itemID to bibliography entry wrapper
  function, for use in HTML link wrappers and the like.
  Thanks to Phillip Lord at Newcastle University for
  exploring possible paths for this in the processor
  code.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.141
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix typo that would produce a (well, now "the",
  unfortunately) "sep is undefined" error.

- Avoid lowercasing words within a name that
  are in all caps, when no text-case transformation
  is applied to the name.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.140
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix some issues in the title case function.

- Always treat the year-suffix variable as rendering 
  output, for purposes of cs:group rendering suppression.

- Among the date variables, include only the issued date 
  when generating strings for disambiguation.

- Properly fix the colon suppression (software) bug.

- Do not add an and attribute to the implicit institution 
  node if none exists on the companion name node.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.139
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Do not suppress a colon following a period when
  adjusting punctuation.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.138
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Properly reset state.tmp.suppress_decorations
  in getCitationCluster().

- Avoid corruption of a leading apostrophe.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.137
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Properly update the registry when items are added
  via updateUncitedItems().


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.136
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Do not rely on localeCompare() if a collation is available.
  Avoids erratic results from this function in Firefox Javascript
  implementations.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.135
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix undefined year-suffix-delimiter with implicit
  year suffix.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.134
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Raise output flag on page-first virtual
  variable, so that it is not suppressed when
  rendered as the sole content of a group,
  or of a macro (with an implicit group wrapper).

==========================
Changes in version 1.0.133
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Quash ordinary variables rendered via cs:substitute.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.132
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Wake up debug tracing in Zotero configuration of the processor.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.131
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Do not escape mismatched quote marks.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.130
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Map family name decorations to institutions
  in xmle4x.js. Similar changes may be required
  in xmldom.js.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.129
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix minor spacing bug affecting ASA style.

- Tighten conditions for the automatic insertion
  of spaces between user-supplied affixes and
  citations to which they apply.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.128
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Broaden the list of skip-words used by the title-case
  function. Fixes regression from 2.0.9.

- Tighten conditions for identifying parallel citations
  somewhat.

- Provide some protection against a processor crash when
  parallel citation machinery missteps.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.127
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Reflect extended name lists triggered by disambiguate-add-names
  in bibliography as well as in citations.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.126
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Bugfix for styles that failed to show year-suffix in the bibliography,
  by slightly extending the conditions under which implicit year-suffix 
  is applied.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.125
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Include all institutional authors when rendering, with
  correct joins.  For the present, the join to the last
  institutional author is set always to the "long" form
  of the "and" term, subject to feedback on proper behavior
  and possible extensions to CSL.

  Since I'm not sure of the correct treatment for institutional names
  in author-date strings, we'll just open this up for the present, and
  restrict names included again, if necessary, in light of user
  feedback.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.124
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Taint citations containing cites in which the number of names to be used
  changes as the result of adding or editing another citation.

- Provide translations for container-title and collection-title
  as well as title.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.123
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Deliver U+2019 rather than U+02bc for apostrophes.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.122
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Reset correctly after first citation rendering.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.121
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Properly render a personal author that is succeeded by an institutional
  author as the last entry in a nameset.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.120
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Do not force characters to lower case when invoking
  localeCompare().


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.119
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Introduce processor option to suppress the transliteration
  of titles in bibliography and notes.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.118
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Enable edition as a multilingual variable, and
  force use of the global locale when rendering,
  aligning multilingual behavior of this variable 
  with publisher and publisher place.

- Fix a stack error that occured when both citation
  and bibliography were included in a style that
  makes use of the context-sensitive locale switching
  facility in citeproc-js.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.117
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Escape the value of subsequent-author-substutute when
  rendering bibliographies. This squashes the ??? bug
  flat as a pancake.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.116
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Combine editor and translator names only if the
  editortranslator locale term is defined.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.115
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Revise code for resstoring disambig_restore variable
  after use, in response to reports of random inclusion
  of extra names in citations, in styles that do not
  even require disambiguation. This is not a guaranteed
  fix; we will have to see what people discover in field
  testing.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.114
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Reset disambig_restore variable after use. Prevents disambiguation 
  parameters from leaking between references.

- Fix insane parameters in a style used for testing, which were not previously

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Apply formatting set on family name parts to institutions as well.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.112
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Avoid carrying year-suffix forward to a following 
  reference when performing position-sensitive
  citation updates.



==========================
Changes in version 1.0.111
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Avoid error when sorting items not yet added to the registry,
  triggered in Zotero clients on attempt to enter multiple
  citations in a style that applies sorting to citations.



==========================
Changes in version 1.0.110
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- With collapse="year", do not block the collapsing
  of subsequent authors due to differences that are
  masked by et al. truncation of the name list.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.109
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Use numeric rather than named entities when producing
  HTML, to avoid error if the output is processed as
  XML in an environment in which named entities have
  not been declared.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.108
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Prevent et al. truncation of name lists that are
  less than et-al-min (or et-al-subsequent-min, depending
  on context), when they are accompanied by a clash
  partner with fewer names.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.107
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Quash year-suffix on all entries that successfully
  disambiguate on the basis of names or text added
  with disambiguate="true".


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.106
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix a flaw in disambiguation logic that could
  result in a processor hang, when a creator list
  with fewer names that its predecessor required
  additional names to accomplish disambiguation.
  
- Include the year-suffix as a sortable number
  string in dates used as sort keys. Citations
  that include a year-suffix will now sort correctly
  within the citation.

- Restore XML to defaults before creating E4X
  objects.

- Repair the processor demo page, which broke
  after revision 1.0.95.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.105
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Assure that all ids passed into an array or se
  as a straight variable are stringified. Loosen
  condition statements where appropriate to treat
  numeric IDs of string and numeric type as
  equivalent.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.104
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Make restoreProcessorState() notice that the sequence
  of citations has changed, and assign fresh citation
  IDs to duplicate citations in the input.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.103
==========================

-----------
Enhancement
-----------

- Add a reference to item data in registry objects.

- Provide a registry method getSortedRegistryObjects()
  to return current bibliography data.

- Document new registry method in processor manual.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.102
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Protect against undefined name.multi.main when
  checking headline names for a name tag.

- Fix for undefined value bug. When rendering non-ranged cites collapsed 
  with collapse="year-suffix", and the year suffix is implicit
  (not being rendered through a cs:text node with 
  variable="year-suffix"), add the necessary splice delimiter
  details to the number object.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.101
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Add sortkeys array to skeleton items received during 
  restoreProcessorState() if it is undefined. Avoids
  a processor crash on the first Zotero 2.1 connection 
  to a Zotero 2.0.9 document. Fault reported by Hem
  Sras.


==========================
Changes in version 1.0.100
==========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Allow institutional names to collapse correctly in collapsing citations.

- Add heuristic code to identify Vietnamese names,
  and make it optional.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.99
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix loop constraint variable misassignment that was 
  a likely cause behind reported instability in word 
  processor plugins.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.98
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix failure to honor et-al-subsequent-min
  when it is smaller than et-al-min (which
  it ordinarily is).


======================================
Changes in version 1.0.97 [API change]
======================================

------------
Enhancements
------------

- Replace the methods setLangTagsForCslNameTransliteration()
  and setLangTagsForCslTitleTransliteration() with a single
  method setLangTagsForCslTransliteration().

- Change the multilingual parameters available through the
  default-locale attribute of style files (parameters used
  primarily for testing, not production) to reflect the
  API change described above.

- Add method setOriginalCreatorNameFormatOption() to the
  control API. This allows the name ordering and initialization
  conventions of transliterated names either to track those
  of the original language, or to follow the conventions
  of the target script.

- Document new setOriginalCreatorNameFormatOption() method and 
  the previously added method setOriginalCreatorNameFormsOption()
  in the processor manual, and update the description of testing
  parameters available via the default-locale attribute.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.96
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix global variable assignment. Important for stability.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.95
=========================

------------
Enhancements
------------

- Render multilingual names atomically, and do not
  modify the content of names objects during
  processing. This permits implementation of alternative
  name forms, needed to accomodate a new style rule
  in scientific publishing, that permits author names
  to be given in the original script alongside the
  romanized form.

- Implement the rendering of original name forms,
  where an alternative form of the name is used for
  the primary rendering.


======================================
Changes in version 1.0.94 [API change)
======================================

----------
API change
----------

- The input format for multilingual data changes in
  this version.  The previous format, intended only
  for testing, relied on string parsing to identify
  multilingual data embedded in a given field. While
  this strategy worked for initial testing (its sole
  intended purpose), it is cumbersome and potentially 
  fragile.

  The multilingual input data format recognized beginning 
  with this version of citeproc-js separates multilingual 
  content properly into separate elements, resulting 
  in simpler design and more robust operation.

  The change to the multilingual input format is not
  backward compatible; in the unlikely event that any 
  existing projects have relied upon the old format,
  adjustments will be required to run this version
  of the processor.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.93
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Cast human-readable dates parser as a separate JS module,
  and provide documentation in the processor manual.

- Small change to multiple value handling in cs:number.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.92
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix ordinal suffix assignment to values
  11 - 19 (for English, at least).


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.91
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Set circa rather than fuzzy on uncertain date
  objects in the internal human-readable dates parser.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.90
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Reimplement language conditions through
  cs:layout rather than cs:choose.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.89
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Allow multiple locales to be specified in a condition,
  restrict fallback behavior to base (single two-character) 
  locales, and use the first locale specified in
  language attribute as the locale to be assigned to
  children of the condition when the test is successful.

- Properly honor locale for quotes and punctuation in
  language condition statements.

- Implement dynamic locale-sensitive delimiter and affixes
  with language condition statements.

- Fix minor bug in xmle4x.js XML parser affecting some
  locale load operations.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.88
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fine tuning of language condition logic, to use only
  the base language name for matching, while applying
  the full locale specified in the conditional.

- Refinements to the recently introduced handling of 
  brace-enclosed leading characters as initialized 
  form of names.

- Adjustments to print statement arbitration, suggested
  by Carles Pina and Fergus Gallagher.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.87
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Where et-al-min, et-al-subsequent-min or names-min are
  set to some value larger than an arbitrary threshold of
  50, truncate author lists that are longer than that value
  (plus a buffer value of 2), to raise performance to a 
  reasonable level with large namesets.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.86
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Improve performance when handling very large
  sets of names.

(Thanks to Nick and Carles at Mendeley for reporting,
and for exploring the source of the fault.)


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.85
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Pass full suite of double space suppression tests.

- Language switching within a style works, for both
  localized dates and terms.  (This functionality is
  not yet recognized as valid CSL.)


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.84
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Preserve explicit double spaces in HTML output.

(Released as 1.0.84-1)


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.83
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Use en-dash rather than hyphen in formatted page range
  joins.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.82
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fixes to cs:if and cs:else-if logic.  Was failing to set the
  match attribute on singleton nodes, among other things.

- Treat greek letters as part of the "romanesque" character set, 
  for name formatting purposes.

- If cs:number input has numbers separated by spaces, but also 
  extraneous non-comma, non-ampersand, non-hyphen characters, 
  then render as literal.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.81
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Yet more fixes to locale selection behavior.
  Use en-US if calling application requests an
  unknown style.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.80
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- More fixes to locale selection behavior.

-----------
Enhancement
-----------

- Provide a toggle to override the locale of a style
  with the locale set on the processor at runtime.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.79
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Correct fault in locale fallback behavior.  Had been ignoring
  optional default argument set in the processor.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.78
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Enable the proper parsing and rendering of
  seasons in ranged dates, in the internal
  dates parser.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.77
=========================

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Adjustments to RTF output formatting, by
  Simon Kornblith.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.76
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix bug in locale processing, arising from the
  previous release, that could trigger a processor
  crash.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.75
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Do not apply decorative formatting to name suffixes.

- Fix breakage in ordinal suffix formatting for days
  in a date.

------------
Enhancements
------------

- For an all-lowercase name suffix (such as an explicit "et al."),
  exclude the suffix from the name for disambiguation purposes, and
  include it in the strict short form of the name in the short form 
  of a citation.

- Add and recognize delimiter-precedes-et-al attribute, in
  line with draft CSL proposal.

- Implement grammatical gender sensitivity for ordinal
  suffixes, in line with draft CSL proposal.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.74
=========================

-----------
Enhancement
-----------

- Recognize new Khmer locale for CSL provided by
  Hem Sras.

- When parsing number ranges in the input to cs:number,
  abort parsing when spread of range is over an
  arbitrary limit of 1000.

- Support names-use-last attribute on cs:key.
  (Anticipatory change to support upcoming change
  to CSL schema and specification.)

- Use unicode ellipsis character rather than
  (nonexistent) locale term when splicing
  author listings trucated with et-al-use-last.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.73
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Limit the recognition of multiple numbers
  to cases in which numbers are separated by
  at least one space, to prevent accidental
  reformatting of leaf numbers.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.72
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Allow simple range, comma, and ampersand joins 
  in the input to cs:number, to permit "1st-2nd", 
  "xi-xv", etc.  When multiple numbers are given,
  the following operations are performed:

    (1) ranges are expanded and the numbers are 
        converted to a list; 
    (2) the resulting list is sorted; 
    (3) duplicates are eliminated; 
    (4) ranges are truncated; 
    (5) numeric formatting is performed; and 
    (6) appropriate punctuation is applied to 
        the result.

- Eliminate space following a trailing apostrophe on a 
  dropping-particle, when immediately followed by family
  in rendered output.

- Recognize multiple parameters of position attribute of 
  cs:if and cs:else-if, per CSL 1.0 schema.  For the fix,
  eliminate cutted-and-pasteded code from node_if.js and 
  node_elseif.js, and consolidate in attributes.js.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.71
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Variables (including names) should be (and have been)
  suppressed when rendered via the cs:substitute node
  of cs:names.  Subsequent rendering of any name variable
  after its first use within a given cite was being
  suppressed unconditionally, however, and this behavior
  differed from the Zotero CSL 0.8.1 processor.  This
  patch restores the original behavior, allowing names
  rendered outside of cs:substitute to be used repeatedly
  within a cite.  (The only exception to this behavior
  is a name rendered with et-al-min=1 and et-al-use-first=1,
  which will be clipped from subsequent output.)

- The processor was using the localized close-inner-quote
  character for apostrophes.  This caused problems in
  styles that use alternative quotation marks.  The
  processor now uses a hard-coded apostrophe character
  for apostrophes.

- A bug in the normalization of names, for disambiguation
  purposes, that contain punctuatioin or extraneous spaces
  has been fixed.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.70
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Adopt conventions from Chicago 16th ed. for commas that follow 
  terminal punctuation in user content fields such as title.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.69
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Limit suppression of a year that is identical to the
  volume number only for cites in which volume and 
  container-title are both rendered, and volume precedes 
  container-title.  Suppression allows legal cites such as
  The King v. Lockwood, 99 Eng. Rep. 379 (K.B. 1782) and
  Hastings v. Perkins, 1930 P. 217 (Eng. C.A.) to be handled
  with a single item type and without resorting to presentation
  toggles in the input data.  Limiting suppression to cites
  in which a rendered volume precedes a rendered container-title
  prevents this behavior from corrupting other citation forms.

- Suppress a leading prefix character that is nested at an 
  arbitrary depth on the subsequent sibling hierarchy of the 
  current output blob object, where it would result in duplicate
  punctuation in the flattened output.

- Fix over-aggressive suppression, on subsequent items, of variables 
  that are called through cs:substitute (and are therefore suppressed
  within the current item).

- Define print statement conditionally, following suggestions from 
  Carles Pina and Fergus Gallagher.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.68
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Further refactoring of output queue mechanism, to
  unify all quote-swapping and detection code for
  duplicate terminal punctuation and spaces in a
  single function.  No changes to behavior, unless
  there is a hole in the test suite somewhere.

- Fix an output nesting mismatch error triggered
  by items with two institutional authors in sequence,
  when rendered with a style that sorts on the
  bibliography.

- In the output queue mechanism, fix a bug in the 
  migration of a leading terminal character in a
  prefix to the preceding sibling suffix.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.67
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Reimplement duplicate terminal punctuation handling in new
  adjustPunctuation() function.  Remove old functions used for this
  purpose, which were excessively complex and fragile.  Some
  operations in queue.js may now be redundant, since the new code does
  a much better job of cleaning up the output queue in advance of
  serialization.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.66
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Adjustment the conditions for application
  of year-suffix values.

- Avoid redundant application of year-suffix
  values during disambiguation.

- Provide a default "institution" format blob on
  the output queue, to avoid a processor
  crash with lone institutional author
  names.

Thanks to Carles Pina for bug reports and
testing.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Add e4x declaration when loading e4x parsing
  code in demo.html, to avoid error in the Chrome
  browser. Thanks to Fergus Gallagher for this fix.


(If these changes show some staying power, we can
discuss later whether to name this release
"Route 66" or "Norman Conquest".)


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.65
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Do not needlessly circumvent name disambiguation logic. Reverses 
  a patch introduced in the 1.0.61 through 1.0.64 series of 
  changes.

- Apply the concise and correct fix for the undefined-in-name bug 
  previously addressed by the 1.0.61 through 1.0.64 series of 
  releases. Just replacing an undefined variable with an empty string 
  does the trick.

- Force an initialized name that lacks an explicit string 
  value on initialize-with to full form, but only when using 
  the by-cite disambiguation rule.

- Permit update of year-suffix when it is added, in addition 
  to when it exists and then changes.

- Protect against an undefined value in updateItems(), which 
  can apparently sometimes occur in the course of word processor 
  plugin transactions.

- Map page-first variable to page when snooping for a value. 
  Prevents a lone page-first cs:text node within a cs:group 
  from being suppressed for lack of output.

- Repair recently amended appendCitationCluster() command to 
  return a list of paired values, in accordance with the 
  processor manual.

- Extend restoreProcessorState() to work with an empty argument, 
  for resetting the processor to a pristine state.  Use case 
  suggested by Carles Pina.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Align version tag with version in source in this release.

- Refactor test fixture bundle for restoreProcessorState() function
  to avoid setting globals, and add a fixture to test resetting to 
  an empty state.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.64
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Release tag to pick up the actual changes
  claimed in 1.0.62 and 1.0.63, the checkins
  of which were lost in the shuffle.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.63
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix appendCitationCluster() to return
  a simple string, and required by Zotero 
  RTF Scan or any similar utility.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.62
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Block needless initialization of names where
  the full name is requested and initialization
  is not.

Thanks again to Carles Pina for reporting this
fault.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.61
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Block needless initialization of names where
  form is long, no initialization is requested,
  and last names are identical.

Thanks to Carles Pina for this bug report.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.60
=========================

-----------
Enhancement
-----------

- Turn on the parsing of name prefixes and
  suffixes by default.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.59
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Extend punctuation swapping to cases
  where quotes entered within a locator.

- Implement context-sensitive pluralization
  of labels.

- Fix bug affecting givennames with more
  than two words when rendered in full
  form without initialization.

- Fixes et al. behavior affecting some
  mixed personal and institutional name
  combinations.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.58
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- In multilingual names handling,
  eliminate fallback to default locale
  language. (Running with this configuration
  in an application proved to be confusing.)


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.57
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Correctly handle singleton conditional
  nodes.  Affects cites to theses in the
  Chicago styles.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.56
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Provide for separate configuration of name
  and title transliterations.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.55
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix bug that triggered "registry[id] undefined"
  error in some disambiguation operations.

- Fix bug affecting voluntary suppression
  of small caps in rich text parsing engine.

-----------
Enhancement
-----------

- Add methods for setting multilingual 
  transliteration, translation, and sort 
  parameters on configured processor.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.54
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fixes misplacement of labels set before the
  nameset to which they apply.

=========================
Changes in version 1.0.53
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix a subtle bug that caused full author names to
  be erroneously rendered in citations although the
  style parameters did not permit them.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.52
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Reverse the RTF-related conservatism in the quashing
  of duplicate spaces that was introduced in 1.0.51.

- Add missing parens to suspect test condition (not
  related to any known bug).

----------
API change
----------

- The processor quashes double spaces in the output.
  RTF control words can be terminated with a space, but
  this causes an immediately following space to be lost
  from the output. To avoid this, the RTF output mode of 
  the processor has been adjusted to terminate RTF control
  words with {} rather than space. Applications that convert
  processor output between other formats (such as HTML)
  may need to be adjusted to accomodate this new behavior.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.51
=========================

----------
API change
----------

- Return error objects with details of cites or bibliography
  entries that produce no rendered output.  See processor
  manual for details.

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix string breakage affecting text-case="title".

- Fix over-aggressive quashing of spaces, which affected
  spacing following RTF entities.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Update manual with description of supplementary field
  facility.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.50
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Apply output-mode-specific text_escape function to
  affixes and delimiters.

- Strip XML declaration from CSL and locale strings
  received for parsing in the xmldom.js module.

- Add paranoia fallback to handle comment nodes that
  sneak past the XML parser.

Thanks to Carles Pina for bug reports on the issues
above.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Update manual to indicate support for non-E4X platforms.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.49
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix XML parsing code in xmldom.js to screen XML comments
  from the processor.  Thanks to Carles Pina for reporting
  this fault.

- Tighten up conditions for suppression of the trailing year
  where the volume number and the year have the same value.
  Suppression will no longer occur when the rendered date
  contains additional details (day, month).

- Throw a more meaningful error when an invalid locale
  is requested.  Thanks to Carles Pina.

- Fix missing definition of quotes="false" in formats.js.
  Thanks to Carles Pina.

- Fix bug in handling of capitalized characters used in
  citeproc-js hackaround for multi-character initials.

-----------
Enhancement
-----------

- Extend support for "parallel" legal citations to include
  case and comment string citations used in French legal
  writing.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Adjust demo page to include a comment (to check that
  comment nodes are no longer reaching the processor).
  

=========================
Changes in version 1.0.48
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Further fixes to quashing of duplicate punctuation
  and spaces.

- Fix issues with bibliography slug.

- Properly report orphan shortTitle and journalAbbriviation 
  to group as producing output, when short form is called 
  and main variable is nil.

- Fix bug in short form title support.

- Permit author to vary between parallel citations. Useful
  for French case-and-commentary string cites.

-----------
Enhancement
-----------

- Provide for parsing experimental variables out of the
  content of the note variable.  For use in advance
  testing of styles that require changes to the variables
  available in CSL, or supplied by the calling application.

- Fix a duplicate space issue reported by Carles Pina.

- General refactoring of code for identifying an quashing
  duplicate punctuation and spaces.  The code should be
  easier to control when further issues involving punctuation
  arise down the road.

-----------
Enhancement
-----------

- Provide for replacement of the citation number in
  numbered styles with a slug, so that strings in a
  bibliography listing can be used in a template
  without rerendering.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Fix up stale links in processor manual.

- Fix syntax error in test.py affecting Python 2.5 systems.

- Add explanatory notes to demo.html page, in an effort
  to clarify the way processor output can be styled
  and formatted.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.46
=========================

-----------
Enhancement
-----------

- Add option to updateItems() and updateUncitedItems()
  to suppress sorting of the bibliography.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.45
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix duplicate terminal punctuation
  affecting bibliography output.

- Eliminate dereferencing assignments, for
  compatibility with some JS implementations.

- Suppress duplicate spaces affecting some
  styles.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Fix typo in demo page.

=========================
Changes in version 1.0.44
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Do not treat empty dates as rendering content for purposes of
  implicit group conditional rendering, but do recognize literal 
  date content in the same context."


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.43
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- In test.py, change the -E bundled code dump option to -Z,
  and describe as a Zotero bundle option in script help messages.

- Include an assignment of CSL.error to Zotero.debug in the Zotero
  bundle, so that error messages and warnings from the processor will
  pass through correctly, without crashing the processor.

- Render literal passthrough strings on date objects only when
  the year is included among the requested date elements.

- Add temporary code to normalize the structure of some date 
  input objects.

  (... and so we bid a sad farewell to the Meaning of Life 
  release.)
 

=========================
Changes in version 1.0.42
=========================

-----------
Enhancement
-----------

- Provisional implementation of ellipsis truncation of 
  creator listings as required by APA 6th, in anticipation 
  of upcoming point release of CSL schema and specification.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.41
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Reset processor's internal last_name_rendered variable,
  to prevent previous runs of the processor from affecting
  bibliography output.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.40
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Avoid update to position data of other citations during
  previewing.  On-the-fly updates of related citations upon
  citation edit or insert were broken, but should now work 
  correctly.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.39
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix a tiny bug that could cause erroneous position values when
  previewing under some circumstances, resulting in an incorrect
  cite form in preview, and a different (but correct) cite form
  in the document.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.38
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix appendCitationCluster() to work with the API revision
  made to processCitationCluster() in point release 1.0.28.

-----------
Enhancement
-----------

- When user provides a cite suffix that ends with a full stop,
  suppress the normal inter-cite join.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.37
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Quash duplicate terminal punctuation at the end of citations.
  This can happen where an abbreviated term such as id. or
  ibid. is rendered at the end of a citation in a note style,
  in which the note is terminated with a period.

- Eliminate implicit for loops in array constructs, which is
  sadly not available in Chromium JS engine.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.36
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Refresh citations in which names or year suffixes have
  (potentially) changed.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.35
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Simplify save/restore operations for previewing.

- Tie in tainting code for disambig values registered via disambig_cites.js.  
  Possibly over-aggressive about rerendering now, but it works.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.34
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Include year suffix in clone of disambiguation
  configuration.  Failure to include this parameter
  appears to have been behind some intermittent
  glitches in preview handling of year suffixed
  citations.

- Avoid processor crash when unregistered citation
  objects are encountered in preview mode.  The crash
  points occur during tainting, which is irrelevant
  in preview mode, so no harm is done; but I'm not
  really sure why this would ever happen.  Possibly
  a concurrency issue?

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Eliminate unused keyname on cloned disambig objects.

- Minor formatting cleanup in util_disambig.js.

- Add a couple of paranoia operations to processCitationCluster().

  * Issue a bogus warning citation in the event of a processor
    crash.  This should come out for production.

  * Slice citationsPre and citationsPost when they enter
    the processor.  I've been exploring some instability
    with large numbers of same-author/same-year cites in
    Zotero, and thought that mallability of list input
    might be part of the problem.  No idea whether these
    lists can or do change length or content during processing,
    but just in case.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.33
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- In preview mode, avoid tampering with the registry data,
  of items in the citation to be previewed that already
  exist in the registry.  Fixes errors in subsequent
  rendering of year suffixes.

- Suppress redundant return value for current cite, when it is
  tainted by an update by processCitationCluster().

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Add a further unit test for previewCitationCluster(), to
  uncover year suffix bug.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.32
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix bugs in the handling of document-wide names disambiguation
  that manifested when one or more items with identical names were
  deleted from the registry.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- More thorough tests for previewCitationCluster().

- Add some debugging trace chatter for cmd_cite.js.

- Pointless increment to processor manual version number.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.31
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix some state restore bugs in previewCitationCluster().

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Roll back previewCitationClusterStatic() command that
  was introduced in the last release.  Discussion and more
  careful thought showed that it is not safe and not
  generally a good idea to make blind assumptions about
  document state.

- Extend the test fixtures for previewCitationCluster()
  a bit.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.30
=========================

-----------
Enhancement
-----------

- Add new previewCitationClusterStatic() command, to
  simplify the task of generating previews in the calling
  application.  The command requires only a citation
  object, and an output mode flag (typically "html").

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Document previewCitationClusterStatic() command in the
  processor manual.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.29
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Complete reimplementation of cite-level disambiguation.
  The new code is more compact and maintainable, and
  avoids thrashing behavior that afflicted the previous
  code when a large number of cites required both
  add-names and year-suffix disambiguation.

- Suppress year suffix when fresh ambig keys are generated.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Move disambiguation options from citeproc.citation.opt
  to citeproc.opt.

- Use named year_suffix element on disambiguation configuration
  objects, rather than the anachronistic index value 2.

- Set default value of false rather than number 0 on year_suffix
  element.

- Generate year suffix for any non-false value on year_suffix
  element.


======================================
Changes in version 1.0.28 [API change]
======================================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- This version introduces a significant change to the return
  value of processCitationCluster().  It is now an array with
  two elements, the first being a JS object that serves as a
  data segment, and the second the list of two-element arrays
  representing insertion indexes and strings for insertion
  (as previously documented).  An API change of this scale
  probably calls for some more visible sign in the version
  numbering, but the original statement on versioning says
  that the major and minor numbers will align with the CSL
  schema, so we stay at level 1.0.

- The data segment referred to above contains just one element
  currently, "bibchange", which is true if processing the
  citation results in any change affecting the bibliography.

- This release also introduces one change and one addition to
  style configuration flags.  The flag at citation.opt["citation-number-sort"]
  has been moved to opt.citation_number_sort, for clarity and
  consistency.  A new flag, open.sort_citations, is true if
  citations are sorted by the style in any way.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Document API change in the processor manual.

- Document availability of opt.citation_number_sort and 
  opt.sort_citations in the processor manual.



=========================
Changes in version 1.0.27
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix obvious memory leak and corruption bug affecting sortedItems 
  elements, of citationItem content objects.
  

=========================
Changes in version 1.0.26
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Implement new command restoreProcessorState(), for use in
  ... restoring the processor state, when position variables
  and citation sort keys are already known.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Add entry for new restoreProcessorState() command to processor
  manual.

- A few tests of the restoreProcessorState() command.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.25
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Provide new command, previewCitationCluster(), that returns
  string for hypothetical citation at specified position,
  without affecting processor state.

- Fix bug that would have cause appendCitationCluster() to
  run updateItems() unnecessarily.

- Provide for forced generation of citationID, for use
  in previewing.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Provide more meaningful internal flags for processCitationCluster().

- Add entry for new previewCitationCluster() command to processor
  manual.

- A few tests of the new previewCitationCluster() command.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.24
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Cope with item IDs of numeric type, and roll back
  one patch from 1.0.23 that becomes unnecessary as
  a result.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.23
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Cope with two disambiguation cases, involving add-names and
  add-givenname, that succeeded in crashing the processor.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.22
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Bypass sorting of citations that have a value for "unsorted" 
  in citation.properties.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Document "unsorted" toggle in processor manual.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.21
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Tighten up "NUMERIC" update_mode to mean styles that render
  citation-number in citations (renderings in the bibliography
  are now ignored for purposes of setting this internal flag).

- The numeric styles fix introduced at version 1.0.17 broke with
  styles that sort the bibliography on anything other than
  citation-number (i.e. document first-reference order).  With
  this release, arbitrary sorts of the bibliography work with
  numeric styles.

- Position evaluation code is now invoked only in styles that make
  use of position testing (to save a few cycles).

- Numeric styles now perform targetted citation updates correctly.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.20
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Retain all names added by disambiguate-add-givennames when year-suffix
  is added to a cite.  While not strictly necessary for disambiguation,
  the additional information is useful when scanning a bibliography for
  the target entry.  In the previous implementation, Bennett was guilty
  of thinking too much like a computer with a hash table, and too little
  like a reader with a reference list in front of them.

- Eliminate conditions that erroneously suppressed wrapper tags on
  institutional names.



=========================
Changes in version 1.0.19
=========================

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Set up AGPLv3 as an alternative license to CPAL.

=========================
Changes in version 1.0.18
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- RTF and plain text output specs, provided by Simon Kornblith of
  the Zotero project, Center for History and New Media, George
  Mason University.

- Fix weakness in by-cite disambiguation where (I think) maxing out
  disambiguation parameters results in successful disambiguation of
  all but one of the cites in a pool.  Relevant discussion on
  `xbiblio list @ SourceForge`__.

__ http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=AANLkTimtM7wsRL9dhcb4xUICFdj2VIom_Y2t_1wvG1RQ%40mail.gmail.com&forum_name=xbiblio-devel



-------
Cleanup
-------

- Added -E option to ./test.py, to dump processor code with embedded E4X
  support, as used in Zotero.

- Renamed -b option in ./test.py to -B, for consistency with new -E option.

- Simplify regexp used to identify numbers in numeric variables.  Now
  more conservative, but this is probably right.  No effect on tests.

=========================
Changes in version 1.0.17
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- For styles that sort cites on citation-number, postpone the
  cite sort operation, to allow the registry entry and accompanying
  sequence number to appear in the registry before the sort is
  attempted.

=========================
Changes in version 1.0.16
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix error raised by bad var in warning message.

-------------------------------------
Adjustments to extended functionality
-------------------------------------

- Treat names that have a family element without a given element
  as institutional names, with related adjustments to test fixtures.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Drop test fixture description from processor manual.  This is
  now to be maintained in the manual of the CSL Test Suite.

=========================
Changes in version 1.0.15
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Eliminate implicit rendering of "no date" term by cs:date.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.14
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Remove conditional statement that caused leakage of long-form names into subsequent 
  cites in the MHRA style.

- Fix error in test fixture example contained in the processor manual.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Add ambig key to one block of debugging info in disambig_cites.js

- Set path to styles to point into manually updated external standard tests bundle.

- Remove styles used by standard tests from this archive.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.13
=========================

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Drop standard test fixture data from citeproc-js source repository.

- Adjust test runner test.py to accomodate the directory structure of
  the standalone copy of the test fixtures.

- Add note on the need to add the test fixtures manually to the README.txt 
  file and the processor manual.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.12
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix bug in optional date parser code affecting ranged
  Japanese dates.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Separate local and standard test fixtures, and make necessary
  adjustments to test framework.

- Drop test subdirectories "bundled" and "run" from mercurial.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.11
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Processor now opens a key entry in the abbreviation lists for any 
  field value for which abbreviation is requested, but unavailable.
  This should provide enough to get a circle-of-goodness thing
  going to start crowdsourcing style-specific abbreviation lists.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.10
=========================

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Checking in bundled code for the last change, upping version
  in processor code.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.9
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Cause processor to report its own version as processor_version,
  and the supported CSL version as csl_version.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.8
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix code incompatible with IE6 in util_dateparser.js.

- Fix error in the code for generating year-suffix strings
  (fixes bug affecting very high values unlikely to be encountered
  in actual operation).

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Various small fixes in the tests/citeproc_js processor
  tests directory to get tests working with current version
  of code.

- Make syntax and formatting adjustments to recent code as
  recommended by jslint.

- Fix invalid CSL in one test.

- Drop some extraneous files from the archive.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.7
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Place name suffix after the given name is name-as-sort-order
  rendering, separated by a comma, as required by CMS.

- Provide for quote-escaping of name field parsing, when the
  citeproc-js specific parse-names toggle is used to invoke
  name field pre-parsing.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Tests of citeproc-js name parsing extension, with CMS-correct
  handling of name suffixes.

- Fix placement of name suffix in several tests.

- Move parseName() function from build.js to util_names.js.  

- Test for quote-escaped particles in the family name with name field
  parsing.

- Update to manual to cover the citeproc-js parsing conventions for
  name particles and suffixes.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.6
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Drop suffix from short form of names.

- Use implicit context-sensitive joins (space or comma + space)
  when the cs:et-al element is used in a name (i.e. align behavior
  of this element with behavior of the implicit "et al." term, as
  required by the amended CSL specification).

- Permit use of "initials" with non-byzantine names, when style requires
  initialization of a name.  Will allow truncation of Japanese given
  names to the first character, as required by some book publisher
  styles in Japan, and possibly in other Asian-script domains.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Move a test specific to citeproc-js to citeprocjs group.

- Adjust tests to require implicit application of comma + space prefix
  to et al. term, when cs:et-al is used.

- Simplify handling of "et-al" and "with" joins, eliminating a couple
  of nesting levels.  Preliminary infrastructure for discriminate
  handling of "et-al" and "and" terms with institutional names.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.5
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Give name suffixes the same formatting as the family
  name-part.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.4
========================

-----------
Enhancement
-----------

- Fix articulars preceded by a comma (as Bennett's own name)
  to render correctly in bibliographies, as "Bennett, Frank G., Jr.".

---------------------------
Minor interface adjustments
---------------------------

- Change the "comma_suffix" key used to indicate that a name suffix
  should be preceded by a comma to "comma-suffix", for consistency.


-------
Cleanup
-------

- Fix manual to reflect minor interface adjustments made in 1.0.1 and 
  1.0.4 releases, and to mention the "hereinafter" section of the
  abbreviations object, previously overlooked.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.3
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Use comma + space for delimiter before implicit et al. term, when
  preceded by more than one personal name.  Brings processor behav ior
  into line with current Zotero processor and common style
  requirements.  Context sensitivity is not available with explicit et
  al. term; tha t issue to be addressed in CSL 1.1.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.2
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix errors in the placement of non-dropping particles.

- Fix placement of particles in short-form names.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Fix invalid CSL in test fixtures.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.1
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Return maxoffset and the value of second-field-align itself in the
  header of the return value from makeBibliography() when
  second-field-align is used.

- Correctly set the value of entry-spacing and line-spacing, providing
  for a default value of 1 for both attributes, and permitting them
  to be set to 0.

- Set position to subsequent rather than ibid on cites for which one
  or more notes stand between the current citation and the preceding
  partner.

- Implement and test the baseline value for vertical-align.

- Recognize first-reference-note-number as a variable attribute value
  on cs:if and cs:else-if.  Wake up locator attribute on cs:if and
  cs:else-if.

- Fix uppercasing of terms when rendered at first position, and
  prevent uppercasing otherwise.

- Use a space rather than space + comma as the delimiter preceding
  an implicit et-al term.

- Return entry_ids in the header returned by makeBibliography().  The
  entry_ids value is a list, in turn containing one list per entry
  (the nested list being necessary to provide for parallel citations
  picked up in the bibliography).

- Support for uncited items, via new updateUncitedItems() command.

-----------
Fine tuning
-----------

- Suppress issued year if it matches the volume number exactly.  This
  effect is needed for UK case cites.  It's an exception, so other
  content must take priority; the change comes out if it causes
  problems elsewhere.

- Fixes in node_names.js to make institutional names handling available in note styles.

- In what I think is a harmless divergence from the specification,
  return true for is-numeric for non-numeric variables that end in a
  number.  Some styles require adjustment of joins, such as the
  insertion of a comma, in this case.

- Taint items for a change in sequence number only if citation-number
  is used in the citation.

---------------------------------
Fixes to parallels detection code
---------------------------------

- Fix array overrun bug in parallel detection code.

- When the trailing year is quashed in a cite in initial position
  within a set, quash it also in the final partner.  Needed to
  handle public domain citations.

- Provide looser constraint on minimum variable content for parallels
  detection.  Provide for adding a constraint on item type.

- Eliminate am_master flag, and instead rely on the position of the
  rendered item under analysis within the cite set.  This works after
  eliminating and extraneous cite set list push operation that was
  causing it to fail.

-----------------
Internal bugfixes
-----------------

- Suppress registration of names that do not include a family name.

- Provide for the possibility that subsequent citation forms will not
  include any names, and therefore not produce disambiguation data in
  the registry.

- Avoid rendering of citation numbers when evaluating subsequent cites
  for disambiguation purposes, in node_text.js

- Fix a subtle bug in the rollback of added names, in
  disambig_cites.js.

- Companion changes in node_names.js and cmd_cite.js, to restore
  parameters based on subsequent-form disambiguation to the registry,
  after rendering a first-position cite.

- Fix bug caused by incomplete cs:choose node set as a helper for
  cs:substitute.

- Rename citationIdByItemId to citationsByItemId, and adjust code to
  set this list with pointers instead of IDs.  Leverage availability
  of citation pointers to get near-note conditional working.

---------------------------
Minor interface adjustments
---------------------------

- Extend abbreviations structure with addition sections
  "title", "publisher", and "publisher-place".  Change names of
  abbreviation sections "journal" and "series" to "container-title"
  and "collection-title" respectively, for consistency and clarity.


-------
Cleanup
-------

- Delete tests which, if they had been correctly written, would have
  been invalid CSL.

- Fix tests involving et-al-subsequent-min and
  et-al-subsequent-use-first that were either incorrectly written or
  required a wrong result.

- Align abbreviation list keys with field names in tests.

- Cleanup and reorganization of code related to multi-lingual handling
  and abbreviations.

- Adjust near-note tests to use a simple boolean value on the cite
  supplement element of the item, rather than a note distance.

- Adjust tests to reflect correct lowercasing of ibid term when not at
  first position.

- Change tests to use a space rather than comma+space before et al.
