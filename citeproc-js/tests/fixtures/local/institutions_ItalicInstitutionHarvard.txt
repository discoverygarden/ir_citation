In processor development before proper deployment, I fancied that is
would be desirable to drop the institutional element of the first
author name in the test below.

It's not clear whether that is really the case (in the eyes of people
actually in charge of editing), so at the deployment stage, let's open
this up to include institutional names, and restrict the behavior
selectively if there are requests to do so.
